Hi Bill

In both of my diagrams I decided to go with what provided the most 
in terms of communication.
My use case diagram would have been less communicative and more difficult 
to create if I followed the actual standards for advanced relationships.
By using just normal plain black lines the diagram is less busy and communicates more
than having it covered with <<extends>>,<<includes>>, extension points, generalisations etcc..

If you would like a more detailed iteration I can change the nodes and edges 
to have dashes and arrows that are consistent with Use Case standards.

Kind regards

Henry Cullen
